    Day 3 of 100DaysOfCode...
</h2>
<p>
    It's a Saturday evening, struggling not to sleep without doing something on my VSCode
    otherwise I would break the 100D cycle.

    After fish, what next...
</h2>
<p>
    I woke up feeling motivated after a 10-minute Abs workout in 
    my bedroom and a 3hr cleaning spree. Later on proceeded to te salon 
    for a quick hairdo that would see me through the whole of September 
    and probably October (Whos has money for spending in the salon anyway)
    .It toom 5 hours of painful plaiting. I couldn;t even prepare a simple 
    meal for myself. So I proceeded to 'Wakalucy' for a quick sumptous fish and
    rushed back to the house to check my day with a few lines of code with 
    FCC and that's how I ended up with this crappy paragraph. Yikes!
